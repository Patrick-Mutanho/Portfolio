                My name is Patrick and I am a junior engineer currently working in the renewable energy sector.
                I am very passionate about software development and how we can use software to improve our lives and provide solutions 
                to challeges.  I am interested in machine learning, data science  and developing enterprise software. Learning to program and the fundemaentals 
                of software development has been and is still an ongoing beautiful journey for me. From learning C, JAVA, SQL and Python it has been amazing and I am looking forward to the never ending journey. <br><br>
